### ‚úÖ **Objective & Initial Business Questions**

1. **What is the total revenue, profit, and units sold during the selected period?**
2. **Which months saw the highest and lowest sales?**
3. **How does performance vary by region, state, and sales channel?**
4. **Which products are the top-selling?**
5. **Which retailers are contributing most to the revenue?**
6. **What is the average price per unit and operating margin?**
7. **What patterns or trends can be observed for strategic decision-making?**

### üß© **Steps to Build the Dashboard**

1. **Data Collection & Preparation:**

   * Collected raw transactional data including fields such as invoice date, region, state, product type, sales amount, units sold, cost, profit, and sales method.
   * Cleaned and transformed the data in Power Query Editor: handled missing values, ensured consistent formats, and created calculated columns (e.g., `Price per Unit`, `Operating Margin`).

2. **Data Modeling:**

   * Established relationships between tables (e.g., Date table with Sales table, Product table).
   * Created DAX measures for:

     * `Total Sales`
     * `Operating Profit`
     * `Units Sold`
     * `Price per Unit` (`Sales √∑ Units`)
     * `Operating Margin` (`Profit √∑ Sales`)


3. **Dashboard Design & Visualization:**

   * Created cards for high-level KPIs.
   * Designed a time series chart for monthly trends.
   * Used:

     * **Map** for geographical state-wise distribution.
     * **Donut Chart** for regional sales share.
     * **Bar Charts** for breakdowns by product and retailer.
   * Applied consistent styling for readability (color-coded regions, bold KPI values, etc.).

4. **Interactivity via Slicers:**

   * Implemented **Invoice Date** slicer to allow filtering by time.
   * Added **Sales Method** slicer (In-store, Online, Outlet) for channel-based performance analysis.
   * These slicers make the dashboard dynamic and support self-service exploration by end users.
